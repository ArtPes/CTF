This is my secret diary.
The safest way to keep my secrets is inside a compiled executable program.
As soon as I get popular now, that I have friends, I will start adding my secrets here.
I have used a really strong password that it cant be bruteforced.
Seriously it is 18 digit, alphanumeric, uppercase/lowercase with symbols.
And since my program is already compiled, no one can read the source code in order to view the password!
