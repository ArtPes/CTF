Greetings my dear friends
This is Sheldon Cooper speaking
I am really happy to announce that I have installed our brand new FTP server.
I have created a folder for each one of you so that you can store anything you want as you have asked me to do.
Soon I will be posting here useful information about the roomate agreement and the updated FTP agreement.
Also I will add a few jokes about trains, comic books and Star Wars.
PS: Please dont store important files here as this is set to be anonymous and public accessed.

-Dr. Sheldon Cooper
